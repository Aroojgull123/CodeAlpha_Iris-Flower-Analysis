## ðŸ“Œ Project Title

**Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning**

---

## ðŸ“š Project Description

This project involves analyzing the famous **Iris flower dataset**, one of the most well-known datasets in the field of pattern recognition. The objective is to:

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand feature relationships.
- Apply **machine learning algorithms** to classify iris flowers into three species:
  - *Setosa*
  - *Versicolor*
  - *Virginica*
- Evaluate the performance of models using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

This task is an excellent entry point into supervised learning and classification problems.
